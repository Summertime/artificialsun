# Artificial Sun

We have wrapped the sun in a dyson sphere, and have replaced its existance with a virtual sun, allowing full control over its rate of progression across the skies!

## What it does

Slowly and manually pushes the sun through the sky, going back to the game's default daylight cycle whenever anyone is sleeping (to allow beds to work correctly).
